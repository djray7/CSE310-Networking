# CSE310-Networking

# Overview

This project was meant to provide basic understandings of how computer servers can connect to one another. This to help aid an understanding in cyber security and how to better safeguard information.

The program is meant to send a request to a client, asking for email and name to sign up for a subscription. This information is entered by the client, then sent back to the origin and stored in a dictionary or file.


This program would be used for situations of subscription. A client wished to commit to the online services of a website, and to receive said services the website would need a name and email, maybe even number. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (you will need to show two pieces of software running and communicating with each other) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Network Communication

I choose to code with client/server

This is using TCP
Server Port #:  10.12.185.94
Client Port #:  172.17.240.1

These messages are being sent as string values.

# Development Environment

I completed this code using VScode.

It was completed in Python, using socket and thread libraries.

This last link is really where I got the code from, and was spending most of the time reviewing to understand. I had gone to a few other soures as well, but was becoming even more confused with those. The last link is the most clear out of all that I found. 

# Future Work

* Connecting the server to the command line
* Setting up the information request return
* Have the information added into a dictionary
